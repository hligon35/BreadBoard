This repo is a scaffold for a React Native (Expo) mobile app + a React (Vite) PWA.

## Structure

- `app/` shared app architecture (screens, modules, widgets, stores, mock services)
- `ui/` shared UI primitives
- `mobile/` Expo React Native app (React Navigation)
- `web/` Vite React PWA (React Router)

## Running (after installing deps)

- Install: `npm install`
- Mobile: `npm run mobile`
- Web: `npm run web`

Backend services are intentionally mocked.
